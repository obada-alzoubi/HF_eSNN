# Hierarchical Fusion Evolving Spiking Neural Network for Adaptive Learning 

## Features
The codes and scritps here are my implmenation for Hierarchical Fusion Evolving Spiking Neural Network for Adaptive Learning. The algorithm  has several unqiue features:
* 1- Online Learning. 
* 2- Scaling from unseen classess or labels.
* 3- Biologically-inspired model.
* 4- Dynamical structure. 
* 5- Parallel Compatibility
* 6- Learning from unseen classes. 
* 7- Distributed structur. 
## Starting Point
First and most important, please read the paper. The HFeSNN is open for many development opportunities including spike coding, merging functions, neural model and some parameters. If you are interested in working on the code, please contact me: Obada.y.alzoubi@gmail.com or oalzoubi@laureateintitute.org 
Please run runMe.m and debug it .. you will learn a lot!
