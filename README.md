# Hierarchical Fusion Evolving Spiking Neural Network for Adaptive Learning 

## Features
The codes and scritps here are my implmenation for Hierarchical Fusion Evolving Spiking Neural Network for Adaptive Learning. The algorithm  has several unqiue features:
* 1- Online Learning 
* 2- Scaling from unseen classess or labels.
* 3- Biologically-inspired model
* 4- Dynamic structure 
* 5- Parallel Compatibility
## Starting Point 
Please run runMe.m and debug it .. you will learn a lot!
